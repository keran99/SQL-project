# SQL project (University of Bologna, IT for management)
The web platform manages a database of technical data sheets of plant and animal species. The users registered on the platform form a community, each of them can insert reports of sightings about a plant or animal species, and / or validate the reports made by other users. There are also messaging functions between users, crowfunding campaigns, and the organization of nature-themed events.
